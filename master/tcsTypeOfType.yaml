    An epitype is a specimen or illustration selected to serve as an 
    interpretative type when any kind of holotype, lectotype, etc. is 
    demonstrably ambiguous and cannot be critically identified for purposes of 
    the precise application of the name of a taxon (see Art. ICBN 9.7, 9.18). 
    An epitype supplements, rather than replaces existing types. [Bot./Bio.]

    one species, however, components may be excluded until it contains 
    individuals of only one species [ICZN Article 73.3.2]. [Zoo.]

    'type-suspicious' material. The term is in accordance with the Botanical

    author describing a new species, and is distinct from a type only in the 
    fact that either the Type has not been officially assigned yet, or that the 
    specific material has not been explicitly cited in the typification process 
    (i.e. it was part of the swarm of specimens examined in the process, but 
    not labelled as type itself).

    All of the specimens in the type series of a species or infraspecific taxon 
    other than the holotype (and, in botany, isotypes). Paratypes must have 
    been at the disposition of the author at the time when the original 
    description was created and must have been designated and indicated in the 
    publication. Judgment must be exercised on paratype status, for only rarely 
    are specimens explicitly cited as paratypes, but usually as 'specimens 
    examined', 'other material seen', etc. [Zoo./Bot.]
