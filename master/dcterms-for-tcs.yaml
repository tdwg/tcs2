# title
- localName: title
  label: Taxon concept label
  definition: A name given to the resource.
  usage: null
  notes: >
    In TCS `dcterms:title` is used for the taxonomic concept label [\[senderov_openbiodiv-o_2018\]](../bibliography#senderov_openbiodiv-o_2018), which consists of the Taxon Name and a reference to 
    the publication where the concept is circumscribed, separated by 'sec.', 
    which stands for 'secundus' ('according to'). It is used to indicate one 
    specific meaning of a name – a Taxon Concept – rather than the cumulative 
    nomenclatural and taxonomic legacy associated with the name.
