# Taxon Concept Schema Vocabularies

The human readable documentation is dynamically created from the YAML master
files after updates have been made to these files. Any changes should be made in
the YAML files, not directly in the markdown.

Each term has an associated GitHub issue. Discussion about terms should take
place there. The master documents here will be updated by members of the TCS 2 Task
Group afterwards.
