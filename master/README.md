# TCS 2 Master Documents

This directory contains the master documents from which the
[human-readable documentation](../docs/) is created. Each term has an associated
issue in this repository. Discussion about terms takes place in these issues.
Members of the TCS 2 Task Group will update the relevant master documents
afterwards.

Currently this directory contains the master documents of the following
vocabularies:

### Term lists

- Terms defined in TCS: [tcs.yaml](./tcs.yaml)
- Terms borrowed from Darwin Core: [dwc-for-tcs.yaml](./dwc-for-tcs.yaml)

### Controlled vocabularies

- Taxon Relationship Type Vocabulary: [tcsTaxonRelationshipType.yaml](./tcsTaxonRelationshipType.yaml)
