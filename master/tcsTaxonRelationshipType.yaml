# controlled term: overlaps
- localName: rt004
  label: Overlaps
  skos_inScheme: rt
  controlled_value_string: overlaps
  definition: >-
    The subject and object taxon concepts have partially overlapping taxonomic 
    meanings, _i.e._ they have some members in common, but each concept in 
    addition has members that are not included in the other concept.

# controlled term: ecludes
- localName: rt005
  label: Excludes
  skos_inScheme: rt
  controlled_value_string: excludes
  definition: >-
    The subject and objects taxon concepts have non-overlapping taxonomic 
    meanings, _i.e._ they do not have any members in common.
  usage: null

# controlled term: intersects
- localName: rt006
  label: Intersects
  skos_inScheme: rt
  controlled_value_string: intersects
  definition: >-
    The taxonomic meanings of the subject and object taxon concepts intersect, 
    _i.e._ they have at least one member in common.
  usage: null
  notes: >-
    This relationship type can be used when the more precise nature of the 
    relationship is not known, _e.g._ when dealing with nominal or informal 
    taxon concepts. It is the opposite of `excludes`.<br/>-<br/>-
    intersects = {`isCongruentWith` OR `includes` OR `isIncludedIn` OR 
    `overlaps`} = not {`excludes`}
