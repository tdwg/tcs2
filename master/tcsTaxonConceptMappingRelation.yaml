# controlled term: isCongruentWith
- localName: isCongruentWith
  type: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
  label: Is Congruent With
  controlled_value_string: isCongruentWith
  skos_inScheme: TaxonConceptMappingRelation
  definition: >-
    The subject and object taxon concepts have a congruent taxonomic meaning, 
    i.e. there is no conflict between the concepts
  usage: null
  notes: >-
    The `isCongruentWith` relationship is symmetrical, so if A `isCongruentWith` 
    B then B `isCongruentWith` A, as well as transitive, so if A 
    `isCongruentWith` B and B `isCongruentWith` C it follows that A 
    `isCongruentWith` C.


    ![](media/taxon-relationship-type-is-congruent-with.jpg)


    This relationship can also be written as the formula **A &cong; B** or **A == B**.

# controlled term: includes
- localName: includes
  type: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
  label: Has proper subset
  skos_inScheme: TaxonConceptMappingRelation
  controlled_value_string: includes
  definition: >-
    The subject taxon concept has a more inclusive taxonomic meaning than
    the object taxon concept
  notes: >-
    The `includes` relationship is not symmetric, its inverse 
    relationship being  `isIncludedIn`, so if A `includes` B then B 
    `isIncludedIn` A. The `includes` relationship  is transitive, so 
    if A `includes` B and B `includes` C it follows that A 
    `includes` C.


    ![](media/taxon-relationship-type-includes.jpg)


    This relation type can also be written as the formula **A > B**.
  examples: 
    - TaxonConceptMappingRelation-includes
  github: 53

# controlled term: isIncludedIn
- localName: isIncludedIn
  type: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
  label: Is proper subset of
  skos_inScheme: TaxonConceptMappingRelation
  controlled_value_string: isIncludedIn
  definition: >-
    The subject taxon concept has a less inclusive taxonomic meaning than the 
    object taxon concept
  notes: >-
    The `isIncludedIn` relationship is not symmetric, its inverse 
    relationship being  `includes`, so if A `isIncludedIn` B then B 
    `includes` A. The `isIncludedIn` relationship  is transitive, so 
    if A `isIncludedIn` B and B `isIncludedIn` C it follows that A 
    `isIncludedIn` C.


    ![](media/taxon-relationship-type-is-included-in.jpg)


    This relation type can also be written as the formula **A < B**.
  examples: 
    - TaxonConceptMappingRelation-isIncludedIn
  github: 54

# controlled term: partiallyOverlaps
- localName: partiallyOverlaps
  type: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
  label: partiallyOverlaps
  controlled_value_string: partiallyOverlaps
  skos_inScheme: TaxonConceptMappingRelation
  definition: >-
    The subject and object taxon concepts have partially overlapping taxonomic 
    meanings, _i.e._ they have some members in common, but each concept in 
    addition has members that are not included in the other concept
  notes: >-
    The `partiallyOverlaps`  relationship is symmetrical, so if A 
    `partiallyOverlaps` B then B `partiallyOverlaps` A, but not transitive, so, 
    if A `partiallyOverlaps` B and B `partiallyOverlaps` C, it does not follow 
    that A `partiallyOverlaps` C.


    ![](media/taxon-relationship-type-partially-overlaps.jpg)


    This relationship can also be written as the formula **A >< B**.
  examples:
    - TaxonConceptMappingRelation-partiallyOverlaps
  github: 55

# controlled term: isDisjointFrom
- localName: isDisjointFrom
  type: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
  label: Is disjoint from
  controlled_value_string: isDisjointFrom
  skos_inScheme: TaxonConceptMappingRelation
  definition: >-
    The subject and objects taxon concepts have non-overlapping taxonomic 
    meanings, _i.e._ they do not have any members in common
  notes: >-
    The `isDisjointFrom`  relationship is symmetrical, so if A `isDisjointFrom` 
    B then B `isDisjointFrom` A, but not transitive, so, if A `isDisjointFrom` 
    B and B `isDisjointFrom` C, it does not follow that A `isDisjointFrom` C.


    ![](media/taxon-relationship-type-is-disjoint-from.jpg)


    This relationship can also be written as the formula **A | B**.
  examples: 
    - TaxonConceptMappingRelation-isDisjointFrom
  github: 56

# controlled term: intersects
- localName: intersects
  type: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
  label: Intersects
  skos_inScheme: TaxonConceptMappingRelation
  controlled_value_string: intersects
  definition: >-
    The taxonomic meanings of the subject and object taxon concepts intersect, 
    _i.e._ they have at least one member in common.
  usage: null
  notes: >-
    `intersects` is the opposite of `isDisjointFrom` and the union of 
    `isCongruentWith`, `includes`, `isIncludedIn` and 
    `partiallyOverlaps`, meaning it can be any of these relationships. This 
    relationship type can be used when the more precise nature of the 
    relationship is not known, for example when dealing with statements in 
    traditional synonymies.
