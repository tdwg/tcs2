# property: genericName
- localName: genericName
  label: Generic Name
  definition: The genus part of the scientificName without authorship.
  usage: >-
    This property should not be used for names at and above the rank of genus.
    For those names the uninomial property should be used.

# property: infragenericEpithet
- localName: infragenericEpithet
  label: Infrageneric Epithet
  definition: >-
    The infrageneric part of a binomial name at ranks above species but below 
    genus.
  usage: >-
    Names at ranks between species and genus are composed of two parts; the 
    genus and this infrageneric epithet. This property should therefore always 
    be accompanied by the genus property. If the infragenericEpithet property is 
    present, the uninomial, specificEpithet and infraspecificEpithet properties 
    should be absent.

# property: specificEpithet
- localName: specificEpithet
  label: Specific Epithet
  definition: The name of the first or species epithet of the scientificName.
  usage: >-
    Names at ranks of species and below are composed of two or three words; the 
    genus name, the specific epithet and possibly an infraspecific epithet. 
    This property should therefore always be accompanied by the `genus` property. 
    If the `specificEpithet` property is present the `uninomial` and 
    `infragenericEpithet` properties should be absent.

# property: infraspecificEpithet
- localName: infraspecificEpithet
  label: Infraspecific Epithet
  definition: 'The name of the lowest or terminal infraspecific epithet of the scientificName,
    excluding any rank designation. '
  usage: >-
    Names at ranks below species are composed of three words; the genus name, 
    the specific epithet and an infraspecific epithet. This property should 
    therefore always be accompanied by the `genus` and `specificEpithet` 
    properties. If the `specificEpithet` property is present the `uninomial` and 
    `infragenericEpithet` properties should be absent.

# property: cultivarEpithet
- localName: cultivarEpithet
  label: Cultivar Epithet
  definition: >-
    Part of the name of a cultivar, cultivar group or grex that follows the 
    scientific name.
  usage: >-
    The cultivar epithet follows a well-formed botanical name. Only include
    the string of the epithet. i.e. omit the single quotes around cultivar 
    names, the word nullGroupnull that denotes cultivar group and the + sign 
    used in chimeras.

# namePublishedInYear
- localName: namePublishedInYear
  label: Name Published In Year
  definition: The four-digit year in which the scientificName was published.
  usage: >-
    This is the publication year for the present name combination not for the
    basionym should this be a new combination.
