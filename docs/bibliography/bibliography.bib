	abstract = {Taxonomic concepts (sensu Berendsohn) embody the underlying meanings of scientiﬁc names as stated in a particular publication, thus offering a new way to resolve semantic ambiguities that result from multiple revisions of a taxonomic name. This paper presents a comprehensive and powerful language for representing the relationships among taxonomic concepts. The language features terms and symbols for concept relationships within a single taxonomic hierarchy, or between two related but independently published hierarchies. Taxonomic concepts pertaining to a single hierarchy are characterised by parent/child relationships, whereas those pertaining to two independent hierarchies may have the following basic relationships: congruence, inclusion (non-symmetrical, relative to the side of comparison), overlap, and exclusion. The relationships are asserted by specialists who have the option to add or subtract concepts on one or both sides of a relationship equation in order to reconcile differences between non-congruent taxonomic perspectives. The terms ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘not’ are available, respectively, to connect multiple simultaneously or alternatively valid relationship assessments, or to explicitly negate the validity of a relationship. The language also permits the decomposition of a relationship according to the intensional (property referencing) and ostensive (member pointing) aspects of the compared taxonomic concepts. Adopting the concept relationship language will facilitate a more precise documentation of similarities and differences in multiple succeeding taxonomic perspectives, thereby preparing the stage for an ontology-based integration of taxonomic and related biological information.},

	volume = {87},
	doi = {10.18968/jhbl.87.0_1},
	abstract = {A revision of the Malesian species of Dicranoloma (Ren.) Ren. is presented. In order to clarify the circumscription of Dicranoloma a cladistic analysis was performed, including also species of Dicranum Hedw. and selected other genera. The number of informative characters that could be found was limited. The trees obtained are very sensitive to slight changes in the data matrix or choice of the outgroup. Both Dicranoloma and Dicranum are resolved as paraphyletic, the latter being more basal. Braunfelsia Par., the Dicnemonaceae and a clade containing Mesotus Mitt., Sclerodontium Schwägr. and Leucoloma Brid. appear to have been derived from Dicranoloma stock.  Despite its paraphyletic nature, Dicranoloma sensu Renauld (1901, 1909) was accepted. The genus is characterised by the presence of a limbidium and single-layered alar patches.  For the Malesian region 15 species are accepted in Dicranoloma. Dicranoloma armitii (C. Müll.) Par. and D. fragile Broth. are transferred to Cryptodicranum and Dicranum respectively. One new name, Dicranum psathyrum Klazenga (for Dicranoloma fragile), and two new combinations, Dicranoloma bartramianum (B.H. Allen) Klazenga and D. cutlackii (Norris \& T. Kop.) Klazenga, are made. Dicranum assimile Hampe f. major Fleisch., Dicranoloma euryloma Dix. var. rugifolium Bartr., D. brachyphyllum Nog. and D. havilandii Broth. var. latifolium Van Zanten are synonymised with D. assimile (Hampe) Ren. Dicranoloma novoguineense Broth. \& Geh. is synonymised with D. billardierei (Brid. ex Anon.) Par. Dicranoloma braunfelsioides Herz. is synonymised with D. blumei (Nees) Ren. Dicranum laevifolium Broth. \& Geh., Dicranoloma hemineuron Dix. and D. spiniforme Bartr. are synonymised with Dicranoloma braunii (C. Müll. ex Bosch \& Lac.) Par. Dicranum brevisetum Dozy \& Molk. var. angustum Lac., Dicranoloma defoliatum Froehl. and D. damanhurii Tan \& Mohamed are synonymised with D. brevisetum (Dozy \& Molk.) Par. Dicranoloma formosanum Broth. is synonymised with D. dicarpum (Nees) Par.  Important characters to distinguish species are found in the absence or presence of a central strand in the stem, the areolation of the upper lamina, the anatomy of the costa and the number of sporogones per perichaetium.  Five species of Dicranoloma are endemic to New Guinea, D. cutlackii (Norris \& T. Kop.) Klazenga occurs in New Guinea and in the Moluccas and D. havilandii Broth. is endemic to Mt. Kinabalu on Borneo. Seven species are widespread in Malesia. Most of these have occasionally been found in continental South East Asia as well. Dicranoloma braunii (C. Müll. ex Bosch. \& Lac.) Par. and D. brevisetum (Dozy \& Molk.) Par. are also found in India and Sri Lanka and the former is also widespread in the Pacific. Dicranoloma billardierei (Brid. ex Anon.) Par. is widely distributed in Africa, South America, the Antarctic Islands, Australasia and Malesia. Dicranoloma dicarpum (Nees) Par. is widely distributed in Australasia and also occurs in New Guinea and Taiwan. Cryptodicranum armitii has an East Malesian distribution. Dicranum psathyrum is a species of the Indian subcontinent and continental South East Asia also occurring on Luzon.  Within Malesia all species of Dicranoloma grow at high altitudes, in the submontane forest zone or higher. Four species are also found in monsoon areas. All species are facultative epiphytes, but some are more commonly epiphytic than others.},
