# The Taxon Concept Standard (TCS)

The **Taxon Concept Standard (TCS)**, formerly _Taxon Concept Schema_, is the
TDWG standard specifically for exchange of taxonomic and nomenclatural data. The
current version, TCS 2, takes TCS out of the XML Schema of TCS 1 and turns it
into a vocabulary standard with terms that can be used in many formats,
including CSV, JSON and RDF. The main entities of TCS are the TaxonConcept and
the TaxonName. TCS complements the Darwin Core Taxon and provides a semantic
framework for, and facilitates more accurate transfer of, taxonomic and
nomenclatural data.

## Getting started

- [TCS Term List](./terms/) — The normative list of TCS terms. This document
  defines and describes all TCS terms and provides guidance on how to use them.

- [TCS 2 Feature report](./feature-report/) — A Feature Report is one of two
  documents that have to accompany major enhancements to TDWG standards,
  according to the Vocabulary Maintenance Standard
  ([[[vocabulary_maintenance_specification_task_group_vocabulary_2017](./bibliography/#[vocabulary_maintenance_specification_task_group_2017])]]).
  The _TCS 2 Feature Report_ sets out why TCS 2 was necessary and describes the
  changes from TCS 1 to TCS 2. It also place TCS in the TDWG ecosystem and
  broader context.

- [TCS 2 Implementation experience report](./implementation-experience-report/)
  — The _TCS 2 Implementation Experience Report_ describes how parts of TCS have
  already been implemented and provides a worked out example that highlights the
  TCS Taxon Concept Mappings, a feature of TCS that is not used as often as it
  should be.

- [Examples](./examples/) — All the examples that are referenced in the _TCS
  Term List_.

- [Bibliography](./bibliography/) — The references cited in the varius
  documents.
