# The Taxon Concept Standard (TCS)

<p class="lead">

The <b>Taxon Concept Standard (TCS)</b>, is the TDWG standard for exchange of
taxonomic and nomenclatural data. Formerly an XML Schema, and called <i>Taxon
Concept Schema</i>, TCS is now a vocabulary standard with terms that can be used
in many formats, including CSV, JSON and RDF, and can be used for individual
objects as well as entire data sets. TCS can be used alongside or instead of the
Darwin Core Taxon class. It provides TaxonConcept, TaxonName,
TaxonConceptMapping and NomenclaturalType entities that provide a semantic
framework for and allows more accurate transfer of, taxonomic and nomenclatural
data.

## Getting started

- [TCS Term List](./terms/) — The normative list of TCS terms. This document
  defines and describes all TCS terms and provides guidance on how to use them.

- [TCS 2 Feature report](./feature-report/) — A Feature Report is one of two
  documents that have to accompany major enhancements to TDWG standards,
  according to the Vocabulary Maintenance Standard
  ([[vocabulary_maintenance_specification_task_group_vocabulary_2017](./bibliography/#[vocabulary_maintenance_specification_task_group_2017])]).
  The _TCS 2 Feature Report_ sets out why TCS 2 was necessary and describes the
  changes from TCS 1 to TCS 2. It also places TCS in the TDWG ecosystem and
  broader context.

- [TCS 2 Implementation experience report](./implementation-experience-report/)
  — The _TCS 2 Implementation Experience Report_ describes how parts of TCS have
  already been implemented and provides a worked out example that highlights the
  TCS Taxon Concept Mappings, a feature of TCS that is not used as often as we
  would like it to be.

- [Examples](./examples/) — All the examples that are referenced in the _TCS
  Term List_. Examples are focused on individual terms, but do provide some
  context.

- [Recipes](./recipes/) — Recipes are longer examples that focus on complete
  records and show how TCS can be applied to real-world situations. There are
  recipes for some taxonomic revisions, including the one example that shipped
  with TCS 1, a checklist, a page from the Catalogue of Life and entries from
  AviBase.

- [Bibliography](./bibliography/) — The references cited in the varius
  documents.
