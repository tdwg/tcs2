    The Taxon Concept Standard (TCS), is the TDWG standard for exchange of
    taxonomic and nomenclatural data. Formerly an XML Schema, and called Taxon
    Concept Schema, TCS is now a vocabulary standard with terms that can be used
    in many formats, including CSV, JSON and RDF, and for individual objects as
    well as entire data sets. TCS can be used alongside or instead of the Darwin
    Core Taxon class. It defines Taxon Concept, Taxon Name, Taxon Concept
    Mapping and Nomenclatural Type classes, which provide a semantic framework
    for, and allow more accurate transfer of, taxonomic and nomenclatural data.
