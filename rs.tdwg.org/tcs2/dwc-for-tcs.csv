scientificNameAuthorship,Scientific Name Authorship,The authorship information for the `scientificName` formatted according to the conventions of the applicable `nomenclaturalCode`.,`scientificNameAuthorship` can be used if the `nameString` is a scientific name.,,,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonName
namePublishedIn,Name Published In,A reference for the publication in which the `dwc:scientificName` was originally established under the rules of the associated `dwc:nomenclaturalCode`.,,"This is the string literal equivalent of the TCS `namePublishedIn`. It can be used if one wants to give the protologue as a string, as in many botanical publications.",,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonName
namePublishedInYear,Name Published In Year,The four-digit year in which the `scientificName` was published.,"This is the publication year for the present name combination, not the basionym should this be a new combination.",,,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonName
verbatimTaxonRank,Verbatim Taxon Rank,The taxonomic rank of the most specific name in the `dwc:scientificName` as it appears in the original record.,,"This term may be used for taxonomic rank designations that are not in the controlled vocabulary that is used. Implementations can decide for themselves if it makes more sense to use this term on a Taxon Concept object or a Taxon Name object, or both.",,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonConcept
genericName,Generic Name,The genus part of the `scientificName` without authorship.,This property SHOULD only be used for names below the rank of genus.,,,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonName
infragenericEpithet,Infrageneric Epithet,The infrageneric part of combinations at ranks above species but below genus.,"Names at ranks between species and genus, e.g. subgenera and sections, are composed of two parts; the genus and the infrageneric epithet. This property SHOULD therefore always be accompanied by the `genericName` property. If the `infragenericEpithet` property is present, the `specificEpithet` and `infraspecificEpithet` properties SHOULD not be present.",,,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonName
specificEpithet,Specific Epithet,The name of the first or species epithet of the scientificName.,"Names at ranks of species and below are composed of two or three parts: the generic name, the specific epithet and possibly an infraspecific epithet. This property SHOULD therefore always be accompanied by the `genus` property. If the `specificEpithet` property is present the `infragenericEpithet` property SHOULD not be present.",,,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonName
infraspecificEpithet,Infraspecific Epithet,"The name of the lowest or terminal infraspecific epithet of the `scientificName`, excluding any rank designation.","Names at ranks below species are composed of three parts; the genus name, the specific epithet and an infraspecific epithet. This property SHOULD therefore always be accompanied by the `genus` and `specificEpithet` properties. If the `infraspecificEpithet` property is present the `infragenericEpithet` property SHOULD not be present.",,,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonName
cultivarEpithet,Cultivar Epithet,"Part of the name of a cultivar, cultivar group or grex that follows the scientific name.","The cultivar epithet follows a well-formed botanical name. Only include the string of the epithet. i.e. omit the single quotes around cultivar names, the word 'Group' that denotes cultivar group, the + sign used in chimeras and the 'gx' suffix in greges.",,,,http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property,http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/TaxonName
