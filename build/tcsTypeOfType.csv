t025,originalmaterial,t,originalmaterial,"'type-suspicious' material. The term is in accordance with the Botanical  Code, where it is used for material that has been at the disposal of an  author describing a new species, and is distinct from a type only in the  fact that either the Type has not been officially assigned yet, or that the  specific material has not been explicitly cited in the typification process  (i.e. it was part of the swarm of specimens examined in the process, but  not labelled as type itself).",,,,http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept

t028,paratype,t,paratype,"All of the specimens in the type series of a species or infraspecific taxon  other than the holotype (and, in botany, isotypes). Paratypes must have  been at the disposition of the author at the time when the original  description was created and must have been designated and indicated in the  publication. Judgment must be exercised on paratype status, for only rarely  are specimens explicitly cited as paratypes, but usually as 'specimens  examined', 'other material seen', etc. [Zoo./Bot.]",,,,http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
