# Examples

This directory contains all the examples that are referenced in the [TCS Term
List](../terms). All examples are in TurTLe, which is a serialisation of RDF.

The following namespace aliases are used in the examples:

| Alias | Namespace |
|-------|-----------|
| tcs | http://rs.tdwg.org/tcs/terms/ |
| address | http://schemas.talis.com/2005/address/schema# |
| bibo | http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/ |
| dcterms | http://purl.org/dc/terms/ |
| dwc | http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/ |
| dwciri | http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/iri/ |
| dsw | http://purl.org/dsw/ |
| foaf | http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ |
| gbif | http://rs.gbif.org/terms/1.0/ |
| oa | http://www.w3.org/ns/oa# |
| rdf | http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# |
| rdfs | http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# |
| skosxl | http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl# |

In the examples here, the namespace prefixes have been left out, but each
example has a link to a TTL file in the GitHub repository, which has the
namespace declarations. In the GitHub repository we also have all the examples
in JSON-LD.

All examples have been validated using the [TurTLe Web
Editor](https://felixlohmeier.github.io/turtle-web-editor/) and the [JSON-LD
Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/).
