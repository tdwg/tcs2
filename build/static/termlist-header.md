## Introduction

The Taxon Concept Standard (TCS; renamed from 'Taxon Concept Schema') is the
TDWG standard for taxonomic data. TCS provides TaxonConcept and TaxonName
classes for information about taxon concepts and taxon names, respectively, as
well as a TaxonConceptMapping class for taxon concept alignments and a
NomenclaturalType class for information on typification of taxon names.

TCS provides a consistent way to share and communicate taxonomic and
nomenclatural data.
